		<p class="para">My name is Jason Perreault, a junior currently studying computer science at the University of Massachusetts: Amherst.</p>
		
		I was the lead developer on the frontend of the Shapd application, which is a web application that allows users to custom make shapes in 3D inside 
		the browser, then 3D print them when they are finished. In addition to this, I've done numerous other projects involving HTML, CSS, node.js, Java, 
		C, C++ and more. I consider myself very versitile, highly motivated and a personable, effective communicator.</p>
		
		<p class="para">I have managed groups of five and fifteen, learned new programming languages on the job and been highly effective at both of my previous roles. 
		I have worked in casual, office and at home settings, communicate well with other members of my team and would love to work for you. Hire me!</p>
		
		<p class="para">Feel free to contact me either by emailing me at the address available on my resume or on Github. Links to both are available below.</p>
