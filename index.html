	 <div class="title"> Shapd
		<div class="project">
			<a href="/shapd_frontend"><img class ="imagelinks" src="img/shapd.png";></a>
			Shapd is a web application where users can customize a piece of jewelry. Rendered in three dimensions, 
			the user can adjust any property of the piece they want, change the material, adjust the size, and much more.
			Any change that is made to the piece is rerendered instantly in real time. On the final step of creation, the
			pieces are priced by 3D printing companies, and can then be printed in 3D. This project was done for a startup
			that unfortunately failed, so many of the features that are supported (and still implemented) can't be seen without 
			the server and database interactions.

	  <div class="title"> Shapd Custom
		<div class="project">
			<a href="/shapd_devel"><img class ="imagelinks" src="img/shapddevel.png";></a>
			This project is a variation on Shapd where instead of starting from a set of predefined shapes and changing the way 
			that those shapes look, the user is provided an SVG editing program (built into the web app) that they can use to
			custom draw their shape. Once they are finished drawing the shape in 2D, they can then extrude the shape into 3D 
			space, and change the material and scale of the design that they have created. This project was done up until the
			time that the startup died, so it has some bugs and features only partially implemented.

	  <div class="title"> 3D Monopoly
		<div class="project">
			<a href="/monopoly"><img class ="imagelinks" src="img/monopoly.png";></a>
			Monopoly done in crisp, beautiful 3D. This was done for a school project, where I was a member of a group of five. My 
			contribution to this project, in addition to being the group leader, was all of the 3D components as well as various 
			portions of the gameplay logic.

	  <div class="title"> Tower Defense
		<div class="project">
			<a href="/avm"><img class ="imagelinks" src="img/avm.png";></a>
			Another school project where my group did a variation on tower defense. In our version, each map is divided into a grid
			where the enemies (robots) move and the towers (animals) can be placed. The towers can be placed in real time and cause
			the path of the enemies to change if they obstruct the path. My contribution, other than being the manager of a team 
			of fifteen people, was to integrate all of the client side pieces together, do the power ups, towers, victory conditions,
			home base, create the test suite, write many of the tests, and quite a bit more.
